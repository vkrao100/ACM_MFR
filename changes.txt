Introduction -


Preliminaries -
Added definitions for minimal grobner basis and reduced \Grobner basis


Polynomial modeling - 


Rectification Check -


Rectification Function Computation -


Implementation - 
This section was introduced exclusively for this journal with detailed description 
of the data structure and implementation of our approach.
We describe how we interpret the polynomial functions
as unate cube sets and harness the power of ZDDs to represent and perform efficient 
operations on such sets. 


Experiments -

Added description of benchmarks used in the experiments
Added experiments for Function computation with don't care simplification with complement of off-set
