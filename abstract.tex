\begin{abstract}
This paper presents a symbolic computer algebra based approach for rectification of faulty finite
field arithmetic circuits at multiple nets. Contemporary approaches
that utilize SAT solving and Craig interpolation are
infeasible in rectifying arithmetic circuits. Our approach employs
techniques from polynomial algebra to compute rectification
patches. Given a set of $m$ nets as targets for rectification, first, we
utilize algebra-based techniques to ascertain existence of a rectification 
function at the targets, and subsequently compute a rectification function. 
Further, we show how the algebraic computing model allows to explore the
space of admissible rectification patches, collectively, for the $m$
targets. The model also enables exploitation of don't care 
conditions across the $m$ targets for synthesis of rectification patches. 
Experiments conducted over finite field circuits used in cryptography
applications demonstrate the efficacy of our approach.
