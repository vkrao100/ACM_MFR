\section{Preliminaries}
\label{sec:prelim}
This section reviews some basic concepts from symbolic computer
algebra and associated algorithms that are utilized in this paper. 

%\subsection{Notation and Background}
{\it Finite fields:} Let $\B$ denote the Boolean domain, and $\neg,
\wedge,\vee, \oplus$ the NOT, AND, OR and XOR operators,
respectively. Let $\F_2=\{0,1\}$ be the field of 2 elements, and let
$\F_q = \Fkn$ denote the finite field of $q=2^n$ elements, for a
given $n\in \Z_{> 0}$. $\Fn$ is the $n$-dimensional extension of
$\F_2$, and it is constructed as $\Fn = \F_2[x]\pmod{ P_n(x)}$. Here
$P_n(x) \in \F_2[x]$ is a given degree-$n$ polynomial, {\it
  irreducible} in $\F_2$, with a root $\gamma$, i.e.  $P_n(\gamma)=0$ 
{\red , which is a generator of
$\Fn$. Then $\gamma$ is called a primitive element (PE) of $\Fn$ and
it generates the entire field: $\Fn=\{0,1=\gamma^{2^n - 1}, \gamma,
\gamma^2,\dots,\gamma^{2^n - 2}\}$. Note: $\forall \gamma\in \Fkn, 
\gamma^{2^n-1}=1$.
An element $A \in \Fn$ can be written as $A = a_0 + a_1\cdot \gamma +
\dots + a_{n-1}\cdot\gamma^{n-1}$, where $a_0,\dots,a_{n-1} \in
\F_2$. 
In $\Fn$, the addition ($''+''$) and multiplication
($''\cdot''$) operations are performed in the base field $\F_2$ and
reduced modulo the corresponding primitive polynomial $P_n(x)$. For
$n, k \in \Z_{> 0}$, if $n$ divides $k$, then $\Fn \subset
\Fkk$.}
Thus, $\F_2 \subset \F_{2^n}, \forall n>1$. 
All fields of the type
$\Fkn$ have characteristic 2, and therefore $-1 = +1$ in $\Fkn$. 


{\it Polynomial representation:} Let $R=\F_q[x_1,\dots,x_d]$ be the
polynomial ring in variables $x_1,\dots,x_d$ with coefficients in
$\F_q$. A polynomial $f \in R$ is 
written as a finite sum of terms  $f = c_1 M_1 +  c_2 M_2 + \dots +
c_p M_p$, where $c_1, \dots, c_p$ are coefficients from $\F_q$ and
$M_1, \dots, M_p$ are monomials, i.e. power products of the type
$x_1^{e_{1}}\cdot x_2^{e_{2}}\cdots x_d^{e_{d}}$,  $e_j \in \Z_{\geq  0}$. 
{\red To systematically manipulate the polynomials, a monomial order $>$ (or
a term order) is imposed on $R$ such that the monomials of all
polynomials are ordered according to $>$. }
% A monomial order $>$ (term order) is always imposed on $R$, and
Subject to $>$, we have that $M_1 >M_2 > \dots > M_p$. Then, $lm(f) =
M_1$ denotes the {\it leading monomial} of $f$, and $lt(f) = c_1 M_1$
the  {\it leading   term} of $f$. 
{\red Also, for $f\in R$, $tail(f) = f - lt(f)$.
This work employs {\it lexicographic} (lex) term orders.}  

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% PK
%% A circuit with $n$-bit operands is modeled as a polynomial function in
%% $\Fn$, where variables $x_1,\dots,x_d$ denote the nets of the circuit.
%% %%%% Move to verification
%% Logic gates of the circuit can be modeled with polynomials in
%% $\F_2 \subset \Fn$, with the mapping $\B \mapsto \F_2$:
%% %% As $\Fkk \supset \F_2$, these polynomials can also be
%% %% construed as polynomials in $\Fkk$.

%% z ~ =  ~ a \wedge b ~ \rightarrow ~ z+a \cdot b & \pmod 2\\
%% z ~ =  ~ a \vee b ~ \rightarrow ~ z+a+b+a \cdot b & \pmod 2 \\
%% z ~ =  ~ a \oplus b ~ \rightarrow ~ z+a+b & \pmod 2 
%% \end{split}
%% \end{equation}

{\it Polynomial Reduction:} Let $F=\{f_1,\dots,f_s\}$ be
a set of polynomials in $R$ and $f\in R$ be 
another polynomial. Then $f\xrightarrow{F}_+r$ denotes the {\it
  reduction} of $f$ modulo the set of polynomials $F$ resulting in a
remainder $r$, obtained by iteratively canceling terms in $f$ by
$lt(f_j), f_j\in F$, via polynomial division. 
{\red The remainder $r$ is said to be {\it reduced} such that no term in $r$ is
divisible by the leading term of any $f_j \in F$.

Algorithm~\ref{algo:mv_reduce} (Alg.
1.5.1~\cite{gb_book}) presents the procedure which
performs polynomial reduction by iteratively canceling
one monomial at a time.
Along with the remainder $r$, the algorithm also returns
the set of quotients $\{u_1,\dots,u_s\}$ of division of $f$ by
$\{f_1,\dots,f_s\}$, respectively, such that $f = u_1\cdot
f_1+\dots+u_s\cdot f_s + r$.

%% The algorithm initializes $h$ with the polynomial $f$ and cancels its
%% leading term by some  polynomial $f_j$. If the leading term $lt(h)$
%% cannot be canceled by any $lt(f_j)$, then it is added to the  final
%% remainder $r$ and the process is repeated until all the terms in $h$
%% are analyzed.  
%% We represent the given circuit by way of a set of polynomials
%% $F=\{f_1,\dots,f_s\}$, and for verification and rectification, we
%% analyze the solutions to the polynomial equations $f_1=\dots=f_s=0$. 
%% For this purpose, we
%% consider the {\it ideal} generated by the polynomials, and their {\it
%%   variety.} 

%\begin{Definition}$\bf{\left[Ideal\right]}$
{\it Ideals and varieties:} A given set of polynomials 
$F=\{f_1,\dots,f_s\}$ from $R$, generates the {\bf ideal} $J = \langle
F \rangle \subseteq R$, defined as $J = \langle f_1,\dots,$ $ f_s \rangle = \{
h_1\cdot f_1 + \dots+h_s\cdot f_s~|~h_1,\dots,h_s\in R\}$. 
Polynomials $f_1,\dots,f_s$ form the generators or the {\it basis} of ideal $J$.

%\end{Definition}

Let $\bm{a} = (a_1,\dots,a_d) \in \Fq^d$ be a point in the affine
space, and $f$ a polynomial in $R$. If $f(\bm{a}) = 0$, we say
that $f$ {\it vanishes} on $\bm{a}$. In this work, we have to analyze
the {\it set of all common zeros} of the polynomials of $F = 
\{f_1,\dots,f_s\}$  that lie within the field $\Fq$ -- i.e. the set of
all point $\bm{a} \in \Fq^d$ such that
$f_1(\bm{a})=\dots=f_s(\bm{a})=0$. This zero set is called the {\bf
  variety}, which depends not just on the given set of polynomials in
$F$, but rather on the ideal generated by polynomials. We denote it by
$V(J)$, where: $ V(J)= V_{\Fq}(J) = V_{\Fq}(f_1,\dots,f_s) = \{\bm{a} 
\in \Fq^d: \forall f \in J, f(\bm{a}) = 0\}.$
% {\it \Grobner Bases:} An ideal $J$ may have many different sets of 
% generators. %such that their varieties are the same.
% A \Grobner basis (GB) is one such generating set $G=\{g_1,\dots,g_t\}$

An ideal may have many different sets of generators such that
their varieties are the same. A {\it \Grobner basis} (GB) is
one such generating set with special properties that allows 
to solve many polynomial decision and quantification problems. 
\begin{Definition}
\label{def:gb}
{\bf [\Grobner Basis]}~\cite{gb_book}: 
For a monomial ordering $>$, a set of non-zero polynomials $G =
\{g_1,g_2,\cdots,g_t\}$ contained in an ideal $J$, is called a
\Grobner Basis (GB) of $J$ $\iff$
$\forall f \in J$, $f\xrightarrow{g_1,\dots,g_t}_+0$. 
%$i \in \{1,\cdots, t\}$ 
\end{Definition}
% The GB $G$ for an ideal $J$ can be computed using the  Buchberger's
% algorithm  %\cite{buchberger_thesis}. 
% (cf. Alg. 1.7.1 in~\cite{gb_book}), which
% takes as input a set of polynomials $F = \{f_1,\dots, f_s\}$ and
% computes its GB $G = \{g_1,\dots,g_t\}$, such that $J = \langle
% F\rangle = \langle G\rangle$. Moreover, $V(J) = V(F) = V(G)$. 
% The GB $G$ for an ideal $J$ can be computed using the  Buchberger's
% algorithm  %\cite{buchberger_thesis}. 
% (cf. Alg. 1.7.1 in~\cite{gb_book})
The GB $G$ for an ideal $J$ can be computed using the Buchberger's
algorithm  %\cite{buchberger_thesis}. 
(cf. Alg. 1.7.1 in~\cite{gb_book}), which
takes as input a set of polynomials $F = \{f_1,\dots, f_s\}$ and
computes its GB $G = \{g_1,\dots,g_t\}$, such that $J = \langle
F\rangle = \langle G\rangle$. Moreover, the polynomials of $F$ and $G$
have the same solution-set, i.e. $V(J) = V(F) = V(G)$. 

{\it Ideal Membership Test:} The above definition inherently provides
a decision procedure to test for membership of a polynomial in an ideal:
$f$ is a member of an ideal $J$ {\it if and only if} 
% dividing $f$ by the \Grobner basis $G = GB(J)$ gives the remainder 0. 
$f\xrightarrow{GB(J)}_+0$.
When $f\notin J$,
then division by $GB(J)$ results in a non-zero remainder $r$ that is
unique/canonical. 

% A polynomial $f$ is a member of ideal $J$ iff division of $f$ by
% $GB(J)$ gives the remainder 0. If $f \notin J$,
% then division by $GB(J)$, $f\xrightarrow{GB(J)}_+r$, results in a
% non-zero remainder $r$ that is unique.
% A \Grobner basis can be computed using Buchberger's 
% algorithm (cf. Alg. 1.7.1 in~\cite{gb_book}). 
A \Grobner basis can be further reduced. A reduced \Grobner basis
(redGB) is canonical representation of the ideal $J$.

\begin{Definition} \label{def:rgb}
{\bf [Reduced \Grobner Basis]}:
    A redGB for a polynomial ideal $J$ is 
    a GB $G=\{g_{1},\dots,g_{t}\}$ such that:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item $lc(g_{i})=1,\forall g_{i}\in G$
        \item $\forall g_{i} \in G$, no monomial of $g_{i}$ 
        lies in $\langle lt(G-\{g_{i}\})\rangle$
    \end{itemize}
\end{Definition}

%% {\it Ideal-Poly Conversion:} Over finite fields, given an ideal $J$, 
%% a polynomial $p$ can always be computed 
%% such that $V(p) = V(J)$. Let $\{g_1,\dots,g_t\}$ denote the generators
%% of $J$. Then, the polynomial $p$ can be constructed as, 
%% $p = (1+g_1)(1+g_2)\dots(1+g_t)+1$~\cite{Utkarsh:VLSI18}. 

% A reduced \Grobner basis
% is computed by first computing a minimal \Grobner basis, and then reducing it.

{\it Vanishing Polynomials:} For any element $\varphi\in\Fq$, $\varphi^q=\varphi$ holds. Therefore,
the polynomial $x^q-x$ vanishes everywhere in $\Fq$, and we call it a
{\it vanishing polynomial}. We denote by $F_0 =
\{x_1^q-x_1,\dots,x_d^q-x_d\}$ the set of all vanishing polynomials in
$R$, and  $J_0 = \langle F_0 \rangle$ denotes the ideal of all
vanishing polynomials in $R$. Then $V_{\Fq}(J_0) = \Fq^d$, and for any
ideal $J$, we have that $V_{\Fq}(J)=V_{\Fq}(J+J_0)$.

{\it Ideal-Variety Correspondences:} Given two ideals $J_1 = \langle
f_1,\dots,f_s\rangle,$ $J_2=\langle h_1,\dots,h_r\rangle$, the {\bf
  sum of ideals} is denoted as $J_1 + J_2 = \langle
f_1,\dots,$ $f_s,h_1,\dots,h_r\rangle$, their {\bf product} is
given as $J_1\cdot J_2 = \langle f_i\cdot h_j: 1\leq i\leq s, 1\leq
j\leq r\rangle$, and a {\bf colon ideal} operation is defined as
$J_1:J_2 = \{f \in R\ |\ f\cdot g \in J_1, \forall g \in J_2\}$. 
Ideals and varieties are dual concepts:
$V(J_1 + J_2) = V(J_1) \cap V(J_2)$, whereas $V(J_1\cdot J_2) = V(J_1)
\cup V(J_2)$. A colon ideal operation corresponds the set difference of 
two varieties, $V_{\Fq}(J_1:J_2)=V_{\Fq}(J_1)
\setminus V_{\Fq}(J_2)$. 
% , where ``$\setminus $'' denotes the set difference. 
The complement of a variety $V_{\Fq}(J_1)$ denoted $\overline{V_{\Fq}(J_1)}$, 
can be computed using the colon ideal with vanishing polynomials 
as: $\overline{V_{\Fq}(J_1)} = \Fq^d \setminus
V_{\Fq}(J_1) = V_{\Fq}(J_0) \setminus V_{\Fq}(J_1) = V_{\Fq}(J_0:J_1)$.
% A \Grobner basis is essentially a canonical representation of an
% ideal. 
% The operations of sum, product, and colon ideals --
% $J_1+J_1,J_1\cdot J_2,$ and $J_1:J_2$, respectively, are all performed 
% using their \Grobner bases. 

{\it As varieties over finite fields are a finite set of points in $\Fq^d$,
in this work we interpret the desired rectification functions as
varieties. Thus, we use the above concepts of intersection, union, and
complement of varieties to operate on functions; however, we compute
them algebraically using the \Grobner bases of corresponding ideals.}

% GB computations in $\F_q$ exhibit exponential complexity. 
% In this term order, the variables (nets of the circuit) are ordered
% based on a reverse topological traversal of the circuit from POs to
% PIs. This specific term order '$>$` is called the {\it Reverse
%   Topological Term Order (RTTO)}. Our MFR approach also uses RTTO $>$
% for polynomial representation and manipulation. 


{\red
The computational complexity of GB algorithm is exponential
in the number of variables $d$.
For efficient GB computations on polynomials derived from a circuit,
\cite{lv:tcad2013} proposed the use of a specialized term order that
exploits the topology of the circuit and renders the set of polynomials for 
the gates of the circuit, a \Grobner basis itself. This term order '$>$`
is called the {\it Reverse Topological Term Order (RTTO)}.

\begin{Definition}\label{def:rtto}
{\bf [Reverse Topological Term Order]}~\cite{lv:tcad2013}:
Let $C$ be an arbitrary combinational
circuit. Let $\{x_1, \dots$ $, x_d\}$ denote the set of all variables
(signals) in $C$. Starting from the primary outputs, perform
a {\it reverse topological traversal} of the circuit and order the
variables such that $x_k > x_j$ if $x_k$ appears earlier in the
reverse topological order. Impose a lex term order $>$ to represent each
gate as a polynomial $f_j$, s.t. $f_j = x_k + tail(f_j)$. Then 
set of polynomials $\{f_1,\dots,f_s\}$ corresponding to the gates of the circuits 
is a \Grobner basis when RTTO is used for ordering.
\end{Definition}}

%To overcome the complexity of GB computations,
% While the computations are based on GB theory, 
%we use a specialized term order~\cite{lv:tcad2013} 
%to exploit the topology of the circuit.
%Our verification and rectification tests follow from the Strong Nullstellensatz
